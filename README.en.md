# Cherno Alpha

## Project Introduction
Cherno Alpha is a multifunctional 6-axis robotic arm project integrated with advanced AGI, aiming to enhance the applicability and precision of robots through automation technology.

## Quick Start
```
git clone https://gitee.com/SpannerJun/cherno-alpha-robot.git
cd cherno-alpha-robot
```

## Feature Highlights
- Autonomous coordinate system
- Binocular vision algorithm
- Modular interchangeable tool heads

## Technical Architecture
- Kinematics model
- Mechanical structure design
- Deep learning model
- CAN-based central nervous system
- Controllers and drivers

## Goals

- [X] Motor drive circuit
- [ ] RCM (Robot Computing Module)
- [ ] Binocular depth camera
- [ ] Interchangeable heads with different functions
- [ ] Item classification


## About the Circuit Module

The circuit's core comprises four main boards for the primary control functions of the robotic arm:

* RCM core board
* RCM baseboard
* Stepper motor drive
* Wireless display

The stepper motor drive uses the TMC5240 and TMC5160 chopping drive chips, integrating advanced motion control functions for precise position or speed settings. With an external magnetic encoder, closed-loop control of the motor ensures the precision of the robotic arm's movements. The stepper motor drive **will be open-sourced after the scheme is verified**
